# Deadcode-Removal-Complier
System Programming Academic Project

This compiler, like an IDE, keeps track of all the variables in a particular piece of code and checks if they were initialized properly or initialized but not used.
Once compiled, it returns all the flags set and tells the user about the uninitialized or unused variables.
This helps the user write an error free, memory optimum code.

Used bison, lex and yacc packages to complete the project.
