# Deadcode-Removal 
Implemented using lex and yacc 
The code has two parts. A lex and a yacc code. 
The lex code specializes the tokens to be recognized in the code. 
The yacc code specifies the syntax.
The embedded c code used to check which variables have been declared and which of them have never been used after declaring them.
